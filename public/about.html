        <h2>This Website</h2>
        <p>This website was created to learn about AWS, Infrastructure as Code, Source Control using Git, and CI/CD. It is currently created using a S3 static website, DynamoDB Database, API Gateway, Lambda Functions utilizing Python code to communicate with the DB, served via CloudFront, and the DNS is configured in Google Domains. I created this site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The code is stored in a <a href="https://github.com/mitchisawesom3/resume-site">GitHub Repo</a> where GitHub actions is configured to automatically push the code to the S3 bucket. I will also be creating a Serverless Application Model template and store this within another GitHub repository so I can utilize GitHub actions to automatically push changes to my infrastructure.</p>
